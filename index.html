        BIGHIT MUSIC has finally dropped the announcement ARMY has been waiting for. BTS are returning as a full group with BTS The 5th Album, alongside a brand-new world tour. The news landed on January 4 and instantly sent the fandom into meltdown mode. After years of waiting, solo eras, enlistments, and endless speculation, BTS are entering their next chapter together. The label emphasised that the members were deeply involved in the creative process, shaping the songs with their own thoughts, emotions, and experiences. The album reportedly reflects the struggles, growth, and reflections BTS went through during their time apart, while staying rooted in the sound and storytelling that define them. The announcement positions the tour as part of a “fresh start” for the group, marking their return to global stages together after years of solo schedules and mandatory service. For many fans, this will be the first chance to see all seven members perform together since before enlistments began.
